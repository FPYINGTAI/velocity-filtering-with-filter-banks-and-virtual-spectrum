velocity filtering with filter banks and virtual spectrum

In this paper, the main work is establishing the model under the polar coordinate model, gives the definition of state variables, the velocity filtering method is deduced, filter parameters to set standards and under the matlab simulation, analyzed the performance of the result of the test track
